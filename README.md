# BreakOut Clone in C++

This is a clone of the classic game BreakOut. It is written using the [oLcPixel
GameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine), which is a
great minimal game engine that provides just enough routines to draw graphics
on the screen and receive user's input/output.  Assets are by
[Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl/).

This project is made for learning purposes. I will add more comments as a you
go. Hopefully, it will help out someone in the future. As it is still under
development, please let me know if you found any mistake or bug in the code. 

Cheers!
